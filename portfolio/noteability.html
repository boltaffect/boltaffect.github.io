<h2>Get&nbsp;Found</h2>
<p>We built NoteAbility a new marketing site that would help people find them online. The asthetic of the site is also designed
to appeal to NoteAbility&#8217;s ideal customer. This website was the first time we ever received a call from our client
to let us know that we &#8220;should stop&#8221; since they couldn&#8217;t handle the additional call volume they were&nbsp;receiving.</p>

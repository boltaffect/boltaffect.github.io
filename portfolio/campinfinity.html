<p>CampInfinity is a unique <span class="caps">STEM</span> camp that runs educational camp programs for gifted kids. Because the staff wants to
ensure a good fit between their camp program and the campers that attend they have an admissions process similar to a
private school. But managing admissions is tricky business, so CampInfinity contacted us to help them meet the challenge.

<h2>Automation</h2>
<p>We built a camper application and registration system for CampInfinity to reduce the labor in accepting campers. The
system we built allows for the Ci staff to easily manage applications, registrations, camper information, payments, and
camper&nbsp;checklists.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">HIPAA</span>&nbsp;Security</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re also pleased to say that we provided CampInfinity a <span class="caps">HIPAA</span> compliant system, since camper medical information is
collected. Additionally, our <span class="caps">HIPAA</span> solution was inexpensive, which made a secure system&nbsp;feasible.</p>

<h2>Integrated</h2>
<p>The management app acts as a central portal for parents to login and get information about camp. But we also provided
seamless integration with CampInfinity&#8217;s marketing site, which eliminates double entry and makes it easy to have
accurate information for parents (no matter where they&#8217;re&nbsp;looking).</p>

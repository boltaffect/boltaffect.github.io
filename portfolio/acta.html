<p>Chris at <span class="caps">ACTA</span> approached us to help him build a basic marketing site and donation system for his Nepal based non-profit.
A big goal was to eliminate his monthly costs of collecting funds from donors.

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Donations</h2>
<p>We built a very simple web page that is low maintenance. The single page site simply communicates what <span class="caps">ACTA</span> is doing and
provides a way for donors to contribute their financial gift. And we eliminated Chris&#8217;s monthly payment processing&nbsp;bill.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>We love what Chris is doing in Nepal. Through <span class="caps">ACTA</span> he works to help kids that are part of the child labor used to
produce bricks in many of the brick factories in Kathmandu. We were proud to donate both the development hours and
necessary hosting for this project through our <a href="/power-and-light/">Power and Light</a>&nbsp;program.</p>

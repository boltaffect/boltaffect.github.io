<p>TalentFlood is a startup that came to us with spreadsheets and big ideas to change how businesses
find talent. We built a sophisticated app for TalentFlood that allows job hunters to find the perfect job,
and businesses the ability to find perfect employees.

<h2>Allow for Different User&nbsp;Types</h2>
<p>This project involved creating a system that allows three different user types the ability to create accounts and manage
their profiles: Talent, Hiring Managers, and Organization&nbsp;Employees.</p>
<h2>Multi-step&nbsp;Forms</h2>
<p>The Talent create a profile that includes all of their resume information, life experiences, and an
advanced personality test. All of these steps are displayed on their own screens and saved individuality for both ease
of use for the Talent and data loss protection. We track which sections are complete and about how much more time an applicant
will need to complete the&nbsp;forms.</p>

<h2>Manage Your&nbsp;Organization</h2>
<p>The Hiring Manager users create a company account and then invite their employees to join the system. Hiring Managers are
administrators, but they can select additional users to also have admin&nbsp;privileges.</p>

<h2>Automation Made&nbsp;Easy</h2>
<p>The Hiring Managers create job listings with complex filtering that is made simple through the easy to use setup screen.
We wrote a system that listens for any Job Listing that is added or updated and then automatically applies a fancy
matching routine to rank Talent against the Job Listing. This allows the Hiring Manager to see a short list of
candidates to&nbsp;interview.</p>
